The brief was to create a pre-rendered animation that reflected ARPM's work and also the existing design language. The essence of the design is to communicate the parametric nature of work along with aesthetic design and technology.

To run, make sure OpenFrameworks is installed. Place all the files under the "Apps" folder in OpenFrameworks and compile.
